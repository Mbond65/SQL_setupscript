# SQL_setupscript
A script for installing and configuring SQL Express 2014

<br/>
<h3> Description </h3>
This is a basic script I have created to automate the installation and configuration of SQL Express 2014. If you do want to use this 
script then you will need to edit the binaries variable in the script and point it to the SQL Express 2014 install binaries on your machine.
